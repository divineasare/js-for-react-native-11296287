This repository contains solutions to the DCIT202 Mobile Application Development tasks.

**Task 1:**
The `arrayManipulation.js` file contains a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is multiplied by 4 and each odd number is multiplied by 5.

**Task 2:**
The `arrayManipulation.js` file is updated to include a function `formatArrayStrings` that takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizing the entire string if the number is even, and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

**Task 3:**
The `userInfo.js` file contains a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. The function returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 100).
